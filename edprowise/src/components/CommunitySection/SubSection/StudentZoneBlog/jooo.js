//                     <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                     Understand the Syllabus and Exam Pattern
//                     </li>
//                     <p class="text-black">Before diving into your studies, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the CBSE syllabus and exam pattern. The syllabus outlines the topics and chapters you are expected to study, and knowing it inside out will help you focus your efforts on the right areas.</p>

//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black"> Download the official CBSE syllabus for your grade from the CBSE website or your school’s portal. Familiarize yourself with the weightage of different topics and sections, as this will help you prioritize subjects that require more time and attention.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                     <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                     Create a Realistic Study Plan
//                     </li>
//                    <p class="text-black">A well-organized study plan is key to staying on track and managing time effectively. Break down your study schedule into daily or weekly tasks, allocating sufficient time for each subject based on its difficulty level and importance.</p>
//                     <ol class='d-flex'>
//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black">Aim for a balance between subjects. For example, give more time to subjects you find difficult or need more practice, but don’t neglect the easier ones. Include breaks in your study plan to avoid burnout. A well-rested mind absorbs information better.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                     <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                     Focus on NCERT Books and Previous Year Question Papers
//                     </li>
//                     <p class="text-black">The CBSE exam questions are primarily based on NCERT textbooks, which serve as the core study material. Make sure to study each chapter thoroughly, focusing on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing facts. Additionally, solving previous years’ question papers is crucial for familiarizing yourself with the exam format, types of questions, and time management during exams.</p>
//                     <ol class='d-flex'>
//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black">Practice solving past year papers under exam conditions to improve your speed and accuracy. This will also help you identify areas where you need more revision.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                    <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                    Master the Art of Time Management
//                    </li>
//                    <p class="text-black">One of the most important aspects of excelling in the CBSE exams is time management. During your studies, learn how to divide your time wisely among different subjects, while also ensuring that you dedicate enough time for revision before the exams.</p>
//                    <ol class='d-flex'>
//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black">Allocate specific time slots for each subject during your study hours and stick to them. Practice answering questions within time limits to simulate the exam environment. It will improve your ability to complete the paper within the given time frame.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                    <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                    Regular Revision is Crucial
//                    </li>
//                    <p class="text-black">No matter how well you study initially, revision is the key to retaining information and reinforcing concepts. Set aside time for revision in your study schedule, especially as the exams approach. Focus on revising formulas, definitions, key concepts, and important chapters.</p>
//                       <ol class='d-flex'>
//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black">Use the last few weeks before the exam for intensive revision. Break down your revision into smaller parts, revisiting difficult topics multiple times for better retention.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                      <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                      Don’t Skip Practical and Internal Assessments
//                      </li>
//                      <p class="text-black">In addition to the written exams, practicals and internal assessments (like project work, assignments, and presentations) also carry a significant weightage in your final score. Ensure that you prepare well for practical exams and consistently complete your assignments. </p>
//                      <ol class='d-flex'>
//                         <li class="text-black fw-bold">Tip: </li>
//                         <p class="text-black">Start your project work early and stay consistent with it. Practice practical experiments and understand the theory behind each one, as practical exams often test both theoretical knowledge and hands-on skills.</p>
//                      </ol>

//                      <li class="text-black fw-bold">
//                      Stay Healthy and Manage Stress
//                      </li>
//                      <p class="text-black">While studying hard is important, maintaining your physical and mental well-being is equally essential. A healthy body and mind can help you stay focused and perform better during exams. Don’t let the pressure of exams overwhelm you—stress can hinder your ability to concentrate. </p>
//                      <ol class='d-flex'>
